A number is polite if it can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers; for instance, 7 is polite because it can 
be written at 3 + 4. Some numbers can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers in more than one way; 
for instance, 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 7 + 8. The number of ways that a number can be written as the sum of two
or more consecutive numbers is its politeness. Any number that is a power of 2 cannot be written as the sum of two or 
more consecutive numbers; such a number has a politeness of 0, and is thus impolite.

There is a set of consecutive integers that sum to a given number for each odd divisor of the number greater than 1.
For instance, the divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. The only odd divisor of 28 greater than 1 is 7, so 28 has
a politeness of 1. The set of consecutive integers has length 7 (the divisor) and is 
centered at 4 = 28 รท 7: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7; that works because there are 7 numbers with an average 
of 4 (since they are centered on 4). In some cases, such as the divisor 11 of the number 33, the set of numbers 
includes negative integers: -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8; in that case, the negative integers cancel 
out the corresponding positive integers, so the remaining set is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33.
